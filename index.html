  <h2>HJHZ</h2> <p>Hyojun Jo and Hezin O are graphic designers. Jo runs Corners, a graphic design and risograph printing studio in Euljiro, while O runs a small shop and design studio Oye in Haebangchon. Both born and raised in other cities, the two opened up a map of Seoul and brushed through the unfamiliar, gigantic city and found their eyes resting on a place that goes by the name Huam-dong. It was a rather simple reason—it was the middle of each other’s studio. The newlyweds went straight to find their new home there, after coming to a conclusion of it being an earthy and pleasant neighborhood as they made an actual visit to the area. We were unable to put down all the giggles we couldn’t resist during the jolly interview, so instead we hope you could ‘read’ our laughters through their off-the-wall, earthy space.</p>
